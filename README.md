### Hello there 👋

I am **Raviteja Guttula**

I like building things, mostly in browser and sometimes in real world. I am also interested in learning how to build distributed applications and instrumentation for visibility into a distributed architecture.

I am also interested in the discipline of Quantified-Self, through which I intend to understand myself better and lead a more productive life. 

I am currently pursuing masters with [San Francisco State University](https://www.sfsu.edu/), before that I worked as a software engineer with [Electronic Arts](https://ea.com) for almost 7 years. During my time with EA, I worked under various roles from building full stack applications, 🧑🏻‍💻 building high throughput message processing system, 📈 building monitoring software the message processing pipeline and sometimes performance testing the game backend services.
