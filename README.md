### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I am **Raviteja Guttula**

I like building things, mostly in browser and sometimes in real world. I am also interested in learning stuff that makes things tick as scale and things that give visibility into all chaos that happens in a micro-service architecture.

I am also interested in the discipline of Quantified-Self, through which I intend to understand myself better and lead a more productive life.
