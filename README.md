### Hello there 👋

I am **Raviteja Guttula**

I like building things, mostly in browser and sometimes in real world. I am also interested in learning how to build distributed applications and instrumentation for visibility into a distributed architecture.

During my free time, I explore the ideas of [Quantified-Self](https://quantifiedself.com/) through which I hope to understand myself a little better and optimize my habits to increase my effectiveness.

I am currently working with [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) as a systems engineer, before that I worked as a software engineer with [Electronic Arts](https://ea.com). So far, I worked under various roles from building full stack applications, 🏎 building high throughput message processing system, 📈 building monitoring stack for internal services and ⚡️ performance/reliability testing the game backend services.
